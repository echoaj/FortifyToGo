# Fortify-to-Go
The idea of this project is to provide a way for developers or teams to quickly scan their repositories with fortify.

There are cases where teams don't want to spend the resources getting a fortify licence, set up a fortify environment, or create a fortify CI/CD pipeline. For those cases, why not just direct them to a front end interface where they can input their repository link and a scan will be provided to them on the fly?

That is the idea of Fortify-to-Go.
